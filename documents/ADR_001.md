# Title
Event Driven Architecture

## Status
Completed

## Context
Given the functional and non-functional requirements, an architectural style has to be chosen which fits these best.

## Decision
The kind of system which has to be build is inherently event based: Vital signs measurements coming in from the monitoring devices can be modeled as events to which the system has to react as soon as possible - this is a crucial aspect of the system. Further more, alerts play an important role because medical personel has to be informed immediately when an issue arrises - this is also an event. So, events are the important kind of things that the system has to deal with. Therefore, we chose this style.

## Consequences
A message broker or distributed comit log (like KAFKA) has to be introduced into the architecture. This brings a certain degree of complexity but on the other hand qualities needed (guaratee of delivering messages).
