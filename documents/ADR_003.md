# Title
  Priority of Capabilities

  ## Status
  Proposed

  ## Context
  As we handle human life related data Reliablitiy, and Security are the top priorities.

  ## Decision
  Top Priorities
  - Reliability, Availability: need to record and analyse medical data to identify outstanding trends or values on the fly.
  - Security: should protect the system from vulnerabilities, and personal/medical data, prevent fake or modified data. Also have to take care about physical security as it is on prem (restricted access, prevent natural disasters, hazards)

  Low Priorities:
  - Elasticity: Signals are predictable, spikes not expected
  - Performance: Not "extraordinary", 500ms is the most frequent signal, 500 patients per MonitorMe instance
  - Scalability: More vital sign monitoring devices will come in the future, not top priority now, just take into consideration
  - Deployability: 	Sw and hw is not specified yet but will be based on offered solution. New markets can cause a lot of changes

  ## Consequences
  Technical Architectural decisions based on the above prioritization are documented in Architecture Characteristics
