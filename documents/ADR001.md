# Title
Analyze Rule Builder

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Analyzing the vital signs of all patients in nearly real time is a crucial aspect of the system. The MonitorThem SaaS is the solution which can conduct such analyzing in high quality. But for using it, we have to 

* provide the vitals sign of the patient
* get analysis back

Both tasks can be disrupted by network outages etc. So we need a component in our system to handle/mitigate this problem.

## Decision
Introduction of a component called Analyze Rule Builder. This component is responsible for feeding patients signal data to MonitorMe in order to let it analyze these and give information back in form of rules which can applied to the signals.
The Analyze Rule Builder stores these rules and provides them to the Signal Analize component which actually decides if an alert has to be raised based on these rules.
Threfore, MonitorMe is not directly dependent on the availability of MonitorThem during analyzing.

## Consequences
There is the need of a warming/training phase where MonitorThem gets patient data in order to build rules for judgement of te criticality of signals.
