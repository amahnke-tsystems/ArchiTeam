Please find the ArchiCrew architecture design for the 2024 O'Reilly Kata (MonitorMe) in this repo.

The starting point is [MonitorMe_Architecture](./documents/MonitorMe_Architecture.md) . In the documents directory you can also find the [Architecture Decision Records](./documents/). The [diagrams](./diagrams/) folder encompasses all pictures/diagrams (which are linked in the MonitorMe_Architecture.md).

The archiv folder can savely be ignored. :-)

Have fun!
