Please find the ArchiCrew architecture design for the 2024 O'Reilly Kata (MonitorMe) in this repo.

The starting point is documents/MonitorMe_Architecture.md. In the documents directory you can also find the Architecture Decision Records. The diagrams folder encompasses all pictures/diagrams.

The archiv folder can savely be ignored. :-)

Have fun!
